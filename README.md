# QSweep Single-Qudit Synthesis

QSweep is a pulse-optimal single-qudit synthesis algorithm that is as
efficient as analytical algorithms and can produce circuits in any gateset.
This code repository houses a reference implementation and the experiment
code and data used in the paper. A full production implementation should
make its way into the main BQSKit code base soon, so stay tuned.
